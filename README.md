UPDATE: I am done with several new weapons for the collection, a variety of light, medium, and heavy firearms. There shall be more to follow REAL soon, but until then, I shall upload these. None of them shall be used in Tristania 2, so feel free to pick whichever you desire. I had to remove the muzzleflash for the GIF animation, but of course, each has them in the archive. Damn thing won't handle transparency.

APS Stechkin
As opposed to your average handgun, the APS Stechkin is a light machine pistol with an awesome secondary function: it can fire 5 shots in quick succession with deadly accuracy. In many occassions, this can be better than a shotgun. Bangbangbangbangbang! The APS Stechkin was primarily used by officers in Soviet Russia, and is a very reliable weapon.
The extra frames can be used as sprinting extra frames.

P-11 Aspartame
This light pistol is partially made of plastic, and basically has no weight compared to Backstab, PCV or Colt Woodsman-type handguns. It uses low caliber ammo, from which 15 can fit in its clip. What this gun lacks in firepower makes up in accuracy and fire rate. Recoil is almost nonexistent for this little sweetness, so basically this thing is the triggerhappy peoples' wet dream.

Cluster grenade
Wildweasel and I had a discussion about how grenades and cluster bombs work, and what's the major difference between them. Since I've already made a common grenade, here is a cluster one for you. Of course, you can use it as a regular grenade if you really want to.

Mortar
Rocket launchers are kinda overused for now, I could mention this at the "Gaming clichés" topic that pretty much every FPS game has them, but that's natural and understandable...same goes for shotguns. The Mortar is something which is a little different. It may be used as a rocket launcher for closer distances, however, the primary purpose of the Mortar is to launch it across high walls and into heavily defended buildings. Can also be extremely effective against bunkers, and large quantities of hostile infantry, but mind you, precise aiming requires significant practice! The Mortar warheads cause slightly less damage than the previously made RPG-7, but as a compensation, its reload time is also reduced.

HT-28 Turmoil
A bastard son of the Lee-Enfield No4, the HT-28 Turmoil uses a modified design of the later Lee-Enfield rifle models, with slightly increased accuracy and double clip capacity (the No4 could hold 5 bullets only). This rifle model was developed by FireScape around the same time when the Sabrine MK assault rifles' concept was designed. Once the Sabrine MK and PAMR sniper rifles began to dominate the weapons market, FireScape discontinued the manufacture of the HT-28 Turmoil, albeit several countries purchased the license, so you might say, it is still in business. The Turmoil uses 12,6mm bullets, the secondary function displays the sniper scope.

SVT Tokarev
This rifle is indigenous to Soviet Russia, and was developed around 1942 as a replacement for the Mosin Nagant. Alas, the German advance hindered and eventually ceased its production. It has no sniper scope, but the fire rate is faster than the HT-28 "Turmoil", and firepower is also increased. A perfect choice for Soviet Russia-themed mods and TCs. Who knows...maybe this will be the first step for Russian Overkill 2: Proletar Dictatorship? ;)

PPSh Spergin
The most typical "Soviet Russia" firearm, constructed out of the old Suomi machinegun blueprints. This weapon is like the trademark of the Red Army, and is well-known of its high fire rate (and inaccuracy). The enormous capacity of the loading-clip surmounds most weapons, except the Sapor - it can host 72 pieces of 7,62mm bullets, and release'em in a devastating fusillade! Much like the CA-MG, this weapon is extremely good for close combat - but dramatically useless for greater distances. I fixed together a targeting mode anyhow, but I strongly doubt anyone'll use it.
The frames labelled "Ex" are unused frames, possibly meant for sprinting. Have no idea. Well...no matter...

As I promised, I finished the rest of them weapons & uploaded them to Google Drive, so they are all available for download. A short animation was made for each, this time, muzzleflash included. Don't be surprised if the muzzleflash looks like shit - the GIF animator won't display transparency correctly, it looks fugly no matter what I do. Thankfully, the frames all look brilliant. Each is in 1024×768 resolution. With this, and the available Doom editing tools, you should have no problem putting these fine little toys in good use. Enjoy them!

AK-47
Do I really need to introduce this? Almost every FPS game features it in some form or variant, why should Doom be any different then?

Dagger
It's quite interesting that there are only very few combat knives or bayonets, the only one I found was at Realm667. This bayonet dagger has a slash animation for attacking. The other one, however, is slightly different.

Degtyarev DP
This is the Soviet equivalent of our beloved chaingun, the "record-player gun" and is one of the most fearsome firearms indeed! Its fire rate and destruction power competes with the Sapor, so all I can say, it is MORE than enough to mow down infantry!!! The Degtyarev DP defines the term "bullet hell", much like the Sapor does, there are, however, differences. The DP's "plate" can hold only 47 bullets, as opposed to the 500-bullet bandolier of the Sapor, and has no bullet-shield installed at the front. In return, however, the DP is needn't to be deployed - it can be utilized while in motion, which means, it is much much more mobile.
After the R11 reloading frame, there was about 10-12 blank images, then the DP's barrel appears at the right side of the screen. So no, there are no missing frames. Just insert a few blank ones, and you'll be fine.

Combat knife
A second melee attack for anyone who prefers knives as opposed to chainsaws. This knife has 3 distinct attack animations, so you can slice-and-dice your foes three different ways! I kinda missed the classic "thurst into chest" attack, like in the movie Psycho, but...oh well, sometimes life's a bummer, isn't it? :P

Korgo T-475 "Megablast" infantry siege cannon
This neat little toy is Zsole's personal favourite, rightfully so. Would you like a weapon which works like a shotgun, but each hit is equal to a rocket impact? Sure you would, that'd be like an early Christmas present! The Korgo-T-475 cannon does just like that - it launches a cartridge, which shreds into 6 explosive clusters right after impact. The clusters imminently explode within 0,3 seconds, causing an "explosive shotgun" effect, earning the "Megablaster" nickname for this weapon. While it's not recommended for small terms of combat, the Korgo-T is extremely effective against hordes of infantry, heavily armored targets, and even against low flying aircrafts. The only setback of this weapon is that it has to be manually reloaded after every single shot - it does not use any clips, and the reload time is pretty long...the cartridges BARELY fit into the cannon. Make sure you have a good cover or supressing fire when utilizing this gun. The HE cartridges for the Korgo-T come in individual boxes.

R1-H5N Reason
Originally, this weapon was meant to be a Sten MK-II type machinegun, and for a while, it was marketed under the trademark "Sten MKII". Later however, the Sten MK-II was re-designed, recolored, and its size was also cut down to the size (and so is its caliber and firepower), therefore the R1-H5N "Reason" was born. Reintroducing the original Sten MK-II blueprint to it, it's bigger in size, and can be used with either 9mm and 12,6mm rounds, so it's sorta like a combined rifle. Its popularity was short lived, however, when FireScape introduced its series of Sabrine MK guns.
